      <h2>In addition to being a proud pet parent of both a dog (Beauty) and  a cat (Chicken), I also love to make the most of my free time by visiting DisneyWorld, spending quality time with my family over delicious tacos, and creating cherished memories through fun activities.
</h2>
<h2>I am a big fan of exploring flea markets as they offer an element of surprise and the potential to discover hidden treasures. In the same vein, I also relish the opportunity to fully immerse myself in coding, taking the time to thoroughly understand each language and deepen my knowledge.</h2>
<h2>I am proud to be a Latina and a member of the Latinas in Tech Miami chapter, where I celebrate and embrace my heritage and culture.</h2>
